Woolook is a collection of beautiful Woocommerce blocks. It is like a Woocommerce page builder. But more fun and painless.

== Description ==

[v1.7.0 Huge Update](#developers) | [See Demo Site](https://delabon.com/demo/woolook/) | [See Screenshots](#screenshots) | [Support](https://delabon.com/support)

Woolook is a collection of beautiful Woocommerce blocks. The default blocks design that comes with Woocommerce feels outdated. 

That is why, I have designed and developed Woolook. So you can create beautiful shop pages for your Woocommerce website. Also, you can add Woolook blocks (products) to your articles (posts) and pages.

No more code, shortcodes and complicated page builders. 

It's easy and fun to use. Create pages in minutes from your Wordpress Editor. It's **PAINLESS!**

Display your products and categories on posts and pages!
